# SE-3200 Message Log Project

For this assignment, I created a web application using flask to implement a randomly generated maze that could be solved by the breadth first search algorithm.

To start the server, do:
```bash
flask --app server run
```

Continue by typing in a username, and this will lead you to the page that the maze is generated on. You can click the boxes, and then click 'check maze' to check if your path connects from beginning to the end.

You can also click 'solve maze' for it to automatically solve the maze for you. This does not count for the fastest leaderboard times.
